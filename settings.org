#+TITLE: Literate Emacs Config Wriiten in Org Mode
#+AUTHOR: Brody Lamb
#+EMAIL: brody.lamb30@gmail.com
  
* Preface
  This is a literate emacs config, written in org mode.
  An effort has been made to make this file as concise
  and easy to navigate as possible. Options are able to
  be toggled, as well as packages changed or removed.
  
  This config was made with great +thievery+ inspiration from [[https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch/blob/master/init.el][emacs-from-scratch]].

  Plenty of this config isn't done, nor is it set up to my liking.
  Any heading with the tag *:REFACTOR:* is subject for the code segments to
  be refactored. Obviously headings labelled *TODO* aren't finished.
  
* Package Repositories
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (require 'package)
    ;; Sets a list of package archive mirrors
    (setq package-archives '(("gnu" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
			     ("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
			     ("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/")
			     ("elpa" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))
    (package-initialize)

    ;; Keep packages up to date.
    (unless package-archive-contents
      (package-refresh-contents))

    ;; Use-package is a clean macro for package installing and configuration.
    (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
      (package-install 'use-package))

    (require 'use-package)

* General UI
** Default UI Features
   This section is about the UI features which are built-in
    To Emacs.
   
    We start with things that I think get in the way, such as
    the scroll bar,tool bar, and menu bar.
   
    Disabling line truncating and enabling word wrap makes long lines
    easier to look at than left as stock.
   
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (scroll-bar-mode -1)
     (menu-bar-mode -1) 
     (tool-bar-mode -1)
     (column-number-mode 1)
     (setq-default truncate-lines -1 )
     (setq-default word-wrap 1)
   #+end_src
** Mode Line
   [[https://github.com/jessiehildebrandt/mood-line][mood-line]] is a clean, minimal mode line that supposedly
   is similar to doom-modeline.
   
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (defconst *mood-line* "~/.emacs.d/mood-line.el")
     (load-file *mood-line*)
     (mood-line-mode)
   #+end_src
   
** Theme and Text Font
   Two custom themes are currently installed:
   1. [[https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs][Zenburn]] (which is probably on right now)
   2. [[https://github.com/donderom/jazz-theme][Jazz]]
      
   Jazz is very dark, almost to an unreadable extent.
   It's staying because it can probably be used effectively at night.
   Both of these themes are cloned because again, the less MELPA, the better.
   
   The font currently being used is [[ttps://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans][Fantasque Sans Mono]]. I like this font.
   
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (defconst *theme-directory* "~/.emacs.d/themes/")

     (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path *theme-directory*)
     (load-theme 'zenburn t)
     (set-frame-font "Fantasque Sans Mono 12" nil t)
   #+end_src
      
** Fuzzy Matching :REFACTOR:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (use-package selectrum
       :ensure t
       :config (selectrum-mode 1))

     ;; BROKEY
     (use-package selectrum-prescient
       :ensure t)
     (selectrum-prescient-mode 1)
     (prescient-persist-mode 1)
   #+end_src
** Keybinding Assistance :REFACTOR:
   "Which key" is used to see keybindings because
   emacs has millions.

   If a command is not executed within a second, the
   help window displays. The only exception is the help
   prefix (C-h).
   
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     ;; BROKEY
     (use-package which-key
       :ensure t)
     (setq which-key-show-early-on-C-h 1)
     (setq which-key-idle-delay 1.0)
     (setq which-key-idle-secondary-delay 0.05)
     (which-key-setup-minibuffer)
     (which-key-setup-side-window-bottom)
     (setq which-key-popup-type 'minibuffer)
     (which-key-mode)
   #+end_src
   
** TODO File Tree
   [[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs#quick-start][Treemacs]] is installed, as a file tree can be helpful when programming.

   [f8] is used to toggle the tree buffer.
   
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
	  (use-package treemacs
	    :ensure t
	    :config (global-set-key [f8] 'treemacs))
   #+end_src
   
** Miscellaneous
   I don't know where else to put these.
   The emacs startup screen is annoying and shouldn't show up.
   
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq inhibit-startup-message t)
   #+end_src
   
* TODO Modes
** TODO Org Mode
   Now this is meta...
  
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (setq org-support-shift-select t)
     (setq org-ellipsis " â–¾")
     (set-face-underline 'org-ellipsis nil)
